# Sitecore Marketplace SDK

The open-source Sitecore Marketplace SDK lets JavaScript/TypeScript developers build apps that extend and customize Sitecore products. 

This mono-repository manages the following Marketplace SDK packages:
- `core` – an internal package that sets up secure communication between a Marketplace application (the client) and Sitecore (the host), using the web browser's [PostMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage). For more information, refer to the package [README](packages/core/README.md).
- `client` – required for all Marketplace applications. This package provides secure, bidirectional communication between the Marketplace app and Sitecore. It lets you make queries and perform mutations. Queries support one-off data requests and subscriptions for live updates. Mutations trigger state changes or HTTP requests in Sitecore. For more information, refer to the package [README](packages/client/README.md).
- `xmc` – extends the Client SDK and provides type-safe interfaces for interacting with Sitecore XM Cloud APIs. For more information, refer to the package [README](packages/xmc/README.md).

The packages expose uniform, type-safe, and developer-friendly APIs to speed up your Marketplace app development work.

## Getting started

### Use the SDK in your app
To use the Marketplace SDK in your app, start by installing the `client` package, which is required for all Marketplace apps:
```bash
npm install @sitecore-marketplace-sdk/client
```
If your app needs to interact with XM Cloud APIs, install the `xmc` package, as well:
```bash
npm install @sitecore-marketplace-sdk/xmc
```

Then, refer to the READMEs of the installed packages and the reference documentation in the `/docs` folder.


### Contribute to the SDK 
This section describes how to work with the monorepo so you can contribute to the SDK development.

#### Monorepo structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
/root
├── package.json  // Root configuration, workspaces, and monorepo scripts
├── lerna.json    // Lerna configuration for multi-package management
├── packages
│     ├── core    // Core SDK (communication layer)
│     ├── client  // Client SDK (client application integration)
│     └── xmc     // XMC module (integration with Sitecore XM Cloud APIs)
└── docs          // Reference documentation and project guides
```

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or later. Check your installed version by using the node --version command.
- pnpm 10 or later. Check your installed version by using the pnpm --version command.

#### Installation

Install dependencies from the root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs all dependencies across the packages and sets up the workspaces.

#### Monorepo commands

Here are the main monorepo commands defined in the root `package.json`:

- **Build all packages**  
  Build every package (for example, transpiling TypeScript):

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

- **Clean all packages**  
  Remove build artifacts (such as the `dist` directories):

  ```bash
  pnpm clean
  ```

- **Lint all packages**  
  Run ESLint checks across all packages:

  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```

- **Run all tests**  
  Execute test suites for each package:

  ```bash
  pnpm test:all
  ```

- **Generate Client SDK types - Under development**  
  Automatically generate static TypeScript types for the Client SDK based on the defined schema:

  ```bash
  pnpm generate:client
  ```

#### Working with individual packages

Each package is inside the `packages/` directory. For example, to work with the Core SDK:

1. Navigate into the package folder:
   ```bash
   cd packages/core
   ```
2. Use package-specific scripts (e.g., `build`, `lint`, `test`) as defined in its own `package.json`.
